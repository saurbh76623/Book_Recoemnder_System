 # Book Recommender System â€“ Step-by-Step
 
ðŸ”¹ 1. Data Collection
Use a dataset with books, users, and ratings (e.g. Goodreads, Book-Crossing, Kaggle datasets).

Ensure it has columns like: user_id, book_id, rating, book_title.

ðŸ”¹ 2. Data Cleaning & Preprocessing
Remove:

Nulls

Duplicate rows

Rare books/users (those with very few ratings)

Normalize text (lowercase titles, etc.).

Merge book metadata (title, author) with ratings.

ðŸ”¹ 3. Popularity-Based Recommendation
Calculate average rating and total rating count for each book.

Recommend top-N books based on:

High average rating

High number of ratings (to avoid niche books)

ðŸ”¹ 4. User-Item Matrix Creation
Create a matrix:

Rows: user_id

Columns: book_id

Values: ratings (fill missing with 0 or leave sparse)

ðŸ”¹ 5. Collaborative Filtering (Cosine Similarity)
Use cosine similarity to compute:

Similar books (item-item)

Similar users (user-user)

Recommend books based on similar books or like-minded users.

ðŸ”¹ 6. KMeans Clustering
Treat each user's rating vector as a point in space.

Apply KMeans to cluster similar users.

Assign each user to a cluster.

Recommend popular books within the same cluster.

ðŸ”¹ 7. Recommendation Logic
For a given user:

Find their cluster

Recommend:

Top-rated books in the same cluster

Or similar books via cosine similarity

ðŸ”¹ 8. Evaluation (Optional)
Use metrics like:

Precision@K

Recall@K

RMSE (for predicted ratings)

Or just manually inspect recommendations.

ðŸ”¹ 9. UI / Output
Simple CLI or web interface to:

Enter a user ID or book

Show personalized recommendations
